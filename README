Road Network is a library consisted of efficient, automatic methods for extrapolating a road map from a GIS database to automatically create a geometrically correct and topologically consistent 3D model of large-scale road network to be readily used in a real-time traffic simulation, interactive visualization of virtual world, and autonomous vehicle navigation. The resulting model representation also provides important road features for traffic simulations, including smoothly connected ramps, highways, overpasses, legal merge zones, and intersections with arbitrary states and is independent of the simulation methodologies.
